### II. Externally-funded projects or grants
Postsecondary Information Literacy Readiness Assessment using ILAAP (IITG, $15,500)
 > This project will adapt the Information Literacy Assessment & Advocacy Project (ILAAP) diagnostic tool for use throughout the SUNY system.  This online assessment will provide student admissions and advising officers with a clearer picture of a student’s information literacy competencies (ILC) as they relate to the Association for College and Research Libraries (ACRL) Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education, the SUNY-GER, and campus requirements.  The tool will provide the student with an ILC report that includes a series of “next steps for remediation” when they’ve tested deficient in specific competencies.  The project campuses, University at Buffalo, Erie Community College, and The College at Brockport, will work with creators of ILAAP to customize the questionnaire based on institutional needs.  The revised questionnaire will be administered during the fall 2017 semester, revised, re-administered in the spring 2018, and finalized for rollout across SUNY during the summer 2018.  

OpenSUNY Information Literacy Portal, (IITG, $20,000)
> This project will help share locally created and locally curated information literacy content among  SUNY  librarians  and  faculty.  This  project  will  have  two  tiers:  development  of  guidelines  for  the  creation  of  shareable  and  adaptable  information  literacy  content  as  well  as  development  of  a  platform  to  facilitate  locating  and  exchanging  content.  As  an  end  result,  this  project  will  support  instructional endeavors in all modalities, especially online courses provided through Open SUNY.

SUNY Open Educational Resources: Improving Faculty Discovery and Adoption (IITG, $60,000)
> The purpose of the project is to build on the traditional strengths of SUNY campus libraries by supporting faculty in OER discovery and adoption. The new service model will give faculty access to discovery tools through SUNY Affordable Learning Solutions and Lumen Learning; modularize and improve interoperability and multimedia in the collection of existing Open SUNY textbooks; and embed assessments in OER courses.
