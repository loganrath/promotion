To the APT Committee:

When I started to put together this portfolio it struck me at just how much has happened and changed since my last successful portfolio in February of 2013. I believe I have completed the necessary steps to merit promotion to Librarian. While reflecting on my librarianship, scholarship, and service I came to the realization that Brockport is a place like no other in that it allows our small staff to accomplish so much in support of our students, faculty and staff, and community. I am truly humbled when looking back at what Drake was like back then.

My librarianship is best evidenced through the relationships I have created with the departments I support on campus. My primary duties have shifted slightly during my time here, but I have always been responsible for instruction with our education department. When Charlie Cowling shifted to the archives, I took on support for the main campus part of our social work program. I have worked hard to learn the unique aspects of librarianship that are pertinent to the discipline of social work, and I now feel confident in offering instruction to that realm. Furthermore, I have continued to build my relationship with the department of Education & Human Development (for whom I am also the ordering liaison). In 2016, I received the Chancellor’s Award for Excellence in Librarianship. The nomination for this award was authored by one of my closest collaborators, Allison Wright, and is included in the appendices of this portfolio.

My scholarship has moved into the peer-reviewed level. I have completed six peer-reviewed products including two book chapters, three articles, and one software package. I have presented at many different levels from internal to international. I have also completed many acts of applied scholarship by using my skills and knowledge in the library context. One example of this is the way I’ve used my information design skillset to design the room cards that go outside each lab/classroom to display the events taking place that week. Another example is the Brockport accounts chart that is now included with all new student information as well as posted at the Help Desk and the Information Desk in Drake Library. For metrics, my collected works in Digital Commons have been downloaded 423 times since February 2013. Lastly, I have decided to continue my scholarship through the enrollment into the PhD program at the University at Buffalo in Curriculum, Instruction, and the Science of Learning (CISL). This program will give me the skills I need to further my practice.

My service is mainly focused outside of the library in an effort to help protect the time of my junior colleagues as well as perform service tasks applicable to the rank of Librarian. My largest act of service was serving on the Faculty Roles, Rewards, and Responsibilities Task Force. My role on this task force was to represent faculty librarian interests and to make sure our unique position is understood within the greater context of faculty on campus. I was selected to serve on this by Dr. Dawn Jones, the initial task force chair. On a personal note, I have also worked diligently over the past few years to balance my service commitments with my librarianship. So, while you may find fewer items here than in the past, I hope you will see that my service is more focused than previously.

Again, I am humbled to be a member of the magnificent staff of Drake Memorial Library where we all do our very best each day in support of our intellectual community. The time since my last portfolio seems short. However, when I look back at what I’ve accomplished, I am truly proud of what I’ve done. I hope you will find sufficient evidence in here to show that I meet the guidelines as established in our most recent APT revision to merit a promotion to the rank of Librarian. Should you desire more documentation, please do not hesitate to ask. I attempt to give a curated selection of evidence in support of my portfolio, but should you desire more I would be happy to share it with you.

Sincerely,

Logan Rath
