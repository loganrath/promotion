To the APT Committee:

The library is a very different place than it was when I submitted my last successful portfolio in February of 2013. We now offer different services than we did before and the information landscape has evolved since that time. While our services may have changed, our service-oriented mission has not. We still have students and faculty/staff that need support. I am proud to be one of the people in Drake helping our students, faculty and staff achieve their goals through the use of library resources. 

My librarianship is best evidenced through the relationships I have created with the faculty and students in the departments I support on campus. My primary duties have shifted during my time here, and this year I am grateful to resume my support for the instruction needs with the Department of Education & Human Development, Public Health, and Social Work. During the previous academic year, I focused my instruction knowledge on helping coordinate the functional area trainings for our move to Alma. Before Alma, I took on the instruction load for the main campus portion of undergraduate courses in our social work program when Charlie Cowling shifted to the Rose Archives. I have worked hard to learn the unique aspects of librarianship that are pertinent to the discipline of social work, and I now feel confident in offering instruction to that realm. Furthermore, I have continued to build my relationship with the department of Education & Human Development. The members of the department include my contact information, along with a link to the LibGuide on their syllabi as a resource for their students. The best evidence for my librarianship is likely the Chancellor’s Award for Excellence in Librarianship I received in 2016. The nomination for this award was authored by one of my closest collaborators, Allison Wright, and is included in the appendices of this portfolio.

My scholarship has moved into the peer-reviewed level since the submission of my previous portfolio. I have completed seven peer-reviewed products including two book chapters, four articles, and one software package. I have presented at many different levels from internal to international. I have also completed many acts of applied scholarship by using my skills and knowledge in the library context. One example of this is the way I’ve used my information design skillset to design the room cards that go outside each lab/classroom to display the events taking place that week. Another example is the Brockport accounts chart. This chart is included with all new student information as well as posted at the Help Desk and the Information Desk in Drake Library. For metrics, my collected works in Digital Commons have been downloaded 834 times since February 2013. Lastly, I have decided to continue my scholarship through the enrollment into the PhD program at the University at Buffalo in Curriculum, Instruction, and the Science of Learning (CISL). To date I have completed 28 credits and have passed the first milestone. This program will give me the skills I need to further my practice and become a researcher who is capable of creating scholarship of discovery.

Over the past years, I have tried to focus my service activities to a manageable size while also performing service for aspiring to the rank of Librarian. My campus-wide service is now chairing the Faculty and Processional Staff Policies committee for College Senate. This position places me on two additional campus-wide committees: Policy Management Steering Committee and the Enterprise Risk Management Committees. I also have joined during the past two years, the Committee on Accessibility of the President’s Council on Diversity and Inclusion. My largest service responsibility, though, was serving on the Faculty Roles, Rewards, and Responsibilities Task Force. My role on this task force was to represent faculty librarian interests and to make sure our unique position is understood within the greater context of faculty on campus. I was selected to serve on this by Dr. Dawn Jones, the initial task force chair. In the past I have served on University Faculty Senate committees and as our campus senator. My work on the Awards and Program committee involved helping to evaluate and modify the criteria for Distinguished Librarian. This work has resulted in an additional 3 appointees to the rank of Distinguished Librarian, thus raising the overall profile of SUNY.

Infused within the other pieces of this portfolio, I hope you will find that I possess mastery of subject matter and an effort for continued growth. Right before submitting my previous portfolio I had finished my coursework for my Master of Science in Information Design and Technology. Having finished this degree program, I have spent time applying my degree to the library field. These skills show through in my design efforts of LibGuides, the library webpage, and handouts. Moreover, I use this degree with the instructional design interactions I have with faculty. I have worked to obtain the Expert Instructional Designer certification through Open SUNY’s Center for Online Teaching Excellence. I also hope you will see that my coursework in the PhD program at the University at Buffalo constitutes mastery of subject matter and effort for continued growth.

I believe I have completed the necessary steps to merit promotion to Librarian. I am humbled to be a member of the staff of Drake Memorial Library where we all do our very best each day in support of our intellectual community. When I look back at what I’ve accomplished, I am truly proud of what I’ve done. I hope you will find sufficient evidence in here to show that I meet the guidelines as established in our most recent APT revision to merit a promotion to the rank of Librarian. Should you desire more documentation, please do not hesitate to ask. 

Sincerely,

Logan Rath
